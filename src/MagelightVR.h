// Magelight UI — Skyrim VR presenter (docs/VR_PRESENTER.md).
//
// A second consumer of the textures the host already renders: one OpenVR
// overlay per visible view, laser-pointer input synthesised into the host's
// existing input queue. Runtime-agnostic by construction (SteamVR native and
// OpenComposite): poses and a quad are the only things asked of the runtime;
// intersection, click and scroll are ours.
//
// Threads: every function here that talks to OpenVR runs on the Ultralight/
// present thread from FrameWork (Init, SubmitFrame, Shutdown). Button edges
// come from the game thread (the input sink) through NoteButton — atomics,
// no lock. Nothing here touches engine state: control toggles, UI-mode
// changes and haptics are queued to the game thread by the callers.
//
// Failure posture: any refusal (no runtime, wrong interface version, overlay
// creation failed) leaves the presenter Dormant; the flat host is untouched
// and QueryCapability("vr") stays 0. s_renderDead is never set from here.
