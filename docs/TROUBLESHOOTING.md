# Troubleshooting

Everything below starts in **`Magelight.log`**, in `Documents\My Games\<game>\SKSE\`, where
`<game>` is `Skyrim Special Edition` (Steam SE/AE), `Skyrim Special Edition GOG` (GOG) or
`Skyrim VR`. On a PC whose Documents folder is in OneDrive, that is
`OneDrive\Documents\My Games\...`. The host logs one line per view it creates, per manifest it
reads, per page that fails to load, and per hotkey press. Read it before anything else, and copy
it before you start the game again: each launch overwrites it. Line one names the running
version (`Magelight v0.31.6 loading`); the lines after it name the game (SE, AE or VR, its version and
SKSE's), Windows (or the Wine under Proton), the CPU and RAM, and, once the game's data has loaded,
every graphics adapter with its driver version, the one the game renders on marked. Paths in the
log show your user folder as `%USERPROFILE%`. Each line starts with the date and time, a level
letter (`I`, `W`, `E`) and the thread id.

## Nothing from any Magelight mod appears

- **`the Ultralight runtime under ... is version '...', but this Magelight.dll was built for ...`**
  (0.31.5): a mod manager paired `Magelight.dll` from one mod with the runtime DLLs of another
  (two mods bundle Magelight and neither wins every file). The host stays off for the session
  rather than running a runtime it was not built for. Let ONE copy win every Magelight file: in MO2
  the newer copy lowest in the left pane.
- **`failed to load <runtime DLL> (GetLastError=126)`**: Windows could not load the Ultralight
  runtime. With no Visual C++ redistributable at all the line names `Magelight1Core.dll` (the
  first one loaded); with an old one it usually names `MgWCore.dll`. First check that `Magelight1Core.dll`, `MgWCore.dll`,
  `Magelight1.dll` and `MgACore.dll` are in `Data\SKSE\Plugins\Magelight\` (a missing file gives
  the same code). If they are, install or repair the **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable
  2015-2022 (x64)**, latest version: the runtime needs `MSVCP140_2.dll` and
  `VCRUNTIME140_1.dll`, which older builds of it lack.
- **`Ultralight runtime not found — overlay disabled this session`**: the runtime folder is
  missing or incomplete. Reinstall Magelight UI, and if another mod also ships Magelight, see
  "Two copies of Magelight" below.
- **No `Magelight.log` at all**: SKSE did not load the plugin. Check the requirements for your
  runtime (SKSE64 or SKSEVR, and the matching Address Library) and SKSE's own log.

## Blank page?

The number one question for any web-in-game UI. In order of likelihood:

1. **The page did not load.** Look for `view N page '...' missing — inline banner fallback` or
   `view N FAILED to load - ...` (the mod also gets a `ViewLoadFailed` event). The path is
   printed exactly as resolved. Manifest and Papyrus paths are relative to the mod folder (a
   Papyrus page that is not there is refused); C++ paths are relative to
   `Data/SKSE/Plugins/Magelight/` unless they start with a drive letter.
2. **Vite put `crossorigin` on the script tag.** Over `file://` the page origin is null and the
   module is refused silently. Use `@magelight/vite-plugin`, or strip the attribute and set
   `base: './'` yourself.
3. **Modern syntax.** Ultralight 1.4's WebKit (615) parses through `es2022`; newer is
   unverified. Target `es2022` (the vite-plugin's default) — and do not lower the Ultralight
   SDK without dropping to `es2019` (1.3-era WebKit 610 rejected `?.`/`??`).
4. **A JS exception during mount.** With `"devMode": true` in `Magelight.json` it paints a red
   banner on the page; with or without it, it is in the log as `[view N console/ERROR]`.
5. **It loaded but is transparent.** Pages start with a transparent background; if your CSS
   sets `html { background: transparent }` and nothing else paints, you see the game. Give the
   root element a background.
6. **The view exists but is hidden.** `startVisible` defaults to false; a manifest panel shows
   only when its hotkey (or a DLL/script) opens it. Check the `hotkey <scancode> -> view N`
   lines.

## A page cannot reach its server

Since 0.30.0 a page reaches nothing over the network unless its mod opts in: loopback (a server
on this machine) through the manifest (`"network": "loopback"`), Papyrus `SetNetworkPolicy` or
the mod's DLL; any other host only through the DLL. The log names a mod's policy when the mod
changes it. Since 0.31.5 the policy is a Content-Security-Policy written into the page, so a
refused request shows in the page console as `Refused to connect to ...` (in `Magelight.log` with
`consoleLog` at `warnings` or above); the log's own `blocked network request` line covers only
what the policy let through. Loopback means `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`: a page that used `[::1]`
or another `127.x` address switches to one of those. A page cannot `fetch()` or XHR its own files
either (import or inline the data; a Vite build sets `build.modulePreload.polyfill = false`, which
`@magelight/vite-plugin` does, or it logs one refused fetch per page). Views created through the
v1-v3 C++ `CreateView` belong to no mod: they are file-only and cannot opt in.

## The hotkey does nothing

- A refused binding is logged with the mod and the reason:
  `BindHotkey: scancode N is bound by <mod>` (the first binder keeps a key), or
  `BindHotkey: that scancode is the host's own toggle key` (PageUp unless `toggleKey` in
  `Magelight.json` says otherwise). A manifest adds its file and view name to the line.
- A hotkey never *opens* a page while an engine menu, the console, or a game text field is
  active (`hotkey ignored — an engine menu, the console or text entry is open`), and while a
  page has key focus only that page's own key fires (to close it).
- The user may have rebound or disabled it in `Magelight.json` (`"hotkeys"`); the log says
  `hotkey for 'Mod/view' rebound ...` or `disabled by Magelight.json`.

## I can move but the page stays / I cannot move

UI mode = cursor up + game controls suspended + keyboard to the page. To leave it: Escape,
unless the page has taken Escape for itself (a dialog closing itself); the page's own hotkey,
which always closes it; or the host toggle key (PageUp by default), which always leaves UI mode.
On VR, B or Y leaves it unless the mod bound those buttons itself. Leaving UI mode does not hide
a page by itself (a mod may want it visible, HUD-style); a hotkey close does hide. If controls
stay suspended after a crash-to-menu, load again: the host resets UI mode on every load.

## Two mods fight over the screen

One view holds UI mode at a time, across all mods. The second requester is told `Busy`, the
holder hears `FocusDenied`, and `kUIModeFlagQueue` waits its turn instead. This is by design; a
mod that must be on top uses the `popup` or `system` layer for stacking, not UI mode.

## Two copies of Magelight

A mod such as SeverActions can ship its own copy of Magelight. If you also install Magelight UI
by itself, the copy that wins the file conflict is the one that runs; in MO2 that is the mod
lower in the left pane. Let the newer copy win, and let it win every file: a `Magelight.dll` from one
copy over the runtime DLLs of another is refused at load (0.31.5; the log names both versions)
and the host stays off. Line one of `Magelight.log` names the running version, and a "Magelight
UI needs updating" page means an older copy won.

## Text fields do not type / paste

Ctrl+C/V/X work as of 0.10.2. If typing lands in the game instead of the page, the view is not
the UI-mode view: only the focused view receives keys.

## Performance

Each visible view costs a texture and a paint when it changes; idle pages cost nothing. Keep
HUD widgets small, avoid `position: fixed` full-screen containers on HUD layers, and prefer
`startVisible: false` for panels. Fullscreen views repaint on resolution change. A page's
JavaScript runs on the game's main thread, so heavy script work, or console output in a loop,
costs frame time; strip console logging from release builds.

Loading a page costs frame time too (its parse and first script run). Since 0.31.0 the pages of
views that have not been opened start loading one per frame after a save loads, instead of all in
the first frames, which is meant to spread that cost (not yet measured in game); a page you open
loads at once, and a batch lasts at most about a second. `Magelight.log` sums each batch:
`staggered load - N views over F frames in T ms (...; worst Update X ms)`. A single page whose own
parse is long still costs one long frame. If a mod's page is not ready right after a load because
of this (a mod that waits for its page before it opens it), set `"loadStagger": false` in
`Magelight.json` (and tell the mod's author: a page that is shown loads at once).

Since 0.31.0 pages draw with 4x MSAA on the GPU path, and every page target holds a multisample
copy: a full-screen page at 1440p holds at least about 60 MB more video memory, more when it
composites full-size layers. On a graphics card short of video memory, `"msaa": 2` or `1` in
`Magelight.json` lowers that (`1` is the 0.30.x cost, with stair-stepped curves).

## A page's console lines are missing from the log

Since 0.31.0 `Magelight.log` records a page's console warnings and errors only, as
`[view N console/warn]` and `[view N console/ERROR]`: pages log whatever they like, settings and
keys included, and the log is the file players post. To see `console.log`, `info` and `debug`
lines too, set `"consoleLog": "all"` (or `"devMode": true`) in `Magelight.json`, reproduce, and
set it back before posting the log anywhere. Other rules:

- A message longer than 2 KB is cut, ending in `… [N bytes]` with its full length.
- A view writes at most 20 console lines a second; the rest are counted, and the view's next
  logged line, or its destruction, is preceded by `[view N console] N lines not logged (over 20 a
  second)`.
- The mod that owns the view still receives every message in full through its `ConsoleMessage`
  event, whatever the log records; a mod that forwards its console lines elsewhere is unaffected.
- The settings line (`settings loaded (... consoleLog=warnings)`) names the level in effect.

## The cursor looks different over one mod, or disappears

Since 0.31.0 a mod can bring its own cursor images for its views, and a page that draws its own
pointer can hide the host's (CSS `cursor: none`, or `"none"` in its manifest). Over such a view
you see the mod's cursor, or the page's own, instead of Magelight's; elsewhere, and as soon as
the pointer leaves that view, Magelight's cursor is back. A mod's cursor images win over your
`cursorFile` over that mod's views; a mod's cursor colours (0.31.1) never do. To keep your own cursor everywhere set `"cursorForce": true`
in `Magelight.json`; to drop mods' images but let pages that draw their own pointer keep doing so,
set `"modCursors": false` (since 0.31.1 that also drops a mod's cursor colours, `view N cursor
tint: ...` in the log). `Magelight.log` names each view's cursor (`view N cursor: ...`) and
each image it loads, or why one failed (`cursor image ... - not an image Windows can read`); a
failed image shows Magelight's cursor instead. In VR the laser keeps its dot; with
`vr.cursorDot` `false` it shows the mod's image.

## Rendering oddities (Ultralight 1.4 GPU path)

A rounded box whose borders differ per side and is not fully opaque can draw wedge artifacts.
Keep such boxes opaque or drop the radius. Known engine defect.

## Where things are

`<My Games>` is `Documents\My Games\<game>` as described at the top.

| | |
|---|---|
| Log | `<My Games>\SKSE\Magelight.log` (overwritten each launch) |
| Settings | `<My Games>\SKSE\Magelight.json`, created by hand (see "Magelight.json" below) |
| Page storage | `<My Games>\SKSE\Magelight-cache\<modId>\`: one folder per mod, shared by every save, character and mod-manager profile, not rolled back when a save loads. Delete a mod's folder (game closed) to reset it |
| Runtime | `Data\SKSE\Plugins\Magelight\` |
| Manifest mods | `Data\Magelight\<ModId>\` |

## Magelight.json

Optional; every key has a default. Create it by hand beside `Magelight.log` (a copy in
`Data\SKSE\Plugins\Magelight\` is read only when there is none there). The log names the file
it read, or says that defaults are in effect.

```json
{ "toggleKey": "PageUp", "logLevel": "info", "hotkeys": { "Magelight.Badge/panel": "F4", "Magelight.Badge/badge": 0 } }
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `toggleKey` | `201` (Page Up) | The host toggle key, which always leaves UI mode: a DirectInput scancode or a key name, as in `hotkeys` (key names since 0.31.2). `0` or `"none"` turns it off; Escape and each mod's own keys still leave UI mode. A Windows key code is not a scancode: F3 is `61` or `"F3"`, not `114` (the log warns about that mistake since 0.31.2) |
| `hotkeys` | none | Rebind or disable any mod's hotkey: `"ModId/viewName": "F7"` (a key name or scancode), `0`, `"none"` or `"off"` disables |
| `devMode` | `false` | Hot reload of page files and the on-page JS error banner; also writes every page console line to the log unless `consoleLog` says otherwise |
| `consoleLog` | `"warnings"` | Which page console messages go into the log (0.31.0): `none`, `errors`, `warnings` (warnings and errors) or `all` (`console.log`, `info` and `debug` too). Unset, it is `all` with `devMode` and `warnings` otherwise. See "A page's console lines are missing from the log" |
| `logLevel` | `"info"` | `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error` |
| `forceCpu` | `false` | Skip the GPU driver and use Ultralight's CPU renderer |
| `presentHook` | `"auto"` | Where pages are drawn onto the frame. `auto` draws inside dxgi's own Present only when another mod hooked Present first (an upscaler, for one) and could otherwise draw over the pages, never behind a d3d11.dll or dxgi proxy (ENB, ReShade, Skyrim Upscaler) and never on VR. `late` always does, `vtable` never. Try `late` when a page opens (sound, paused game) but stays invisible, but not with ENB: behind ENB's `d3d11.dll`, `late` can crash the game at start |
| `composite` | `"auto"` | The stage pages are drawn at. `present` draws them over the finished frame at Present; `ui` draws them in the game's own UI pass, as part of the game's menus (click-through HUD pages stay at Present). `auto` uses `ui` when Skyrim Upscaler is installed or the game's swapchain is NVIDIA Streamline's (`sl.interposer.dll`: Skyrim Upscaler, Community Shaders' and Open Shaders' upscaling), since a HUD Fix keeps the game's UI apart from the scene and frame generation drops anything drawn at Present; never on VR. Try `ui` when a page opens but stays invisible behind an upscaler or frame generation |
| `freezeWorld` | `true` | Lets mods stop the game's 3D world render behind a paused fullscreen page (0.31.0; flat only). `false` turns it off for every mod and restores 0.30.6's menu flags; try it if the background behind a page goes black or a page stops answering when it opens |
| `freezeWorldSkipCapture` | `true` | In UI-pass composite (`composite` `ui`, or `auto` behind an upscaler), keeps pages out of the frame the game freezes as the background. `false` if a page flickers when the freeze starts. No effect with composite `present` or `engine`, or with `freezeWorld` `false` |
| `msaa` | `4` | 0.31.0: anti-aliasing samples for page shapes on the GPU path: SVG, icons and other non-rectangular shapes (boxes, rounded corners and text are smooth either way). `1` turns it off, `2`, `4` or `8`. Each count above 1 adds that many copies of every page target in video memory (about 15 MB each at 2560x1440), held while the page exists (hidden too, until a hibernating page frees it): at the default 4 that is at least about 60 MB per full-screen page, plus about the same again for each full-size layer the page composites (a transformed or translucent group, such as a transform-scaled shell). A count the graphics card cannot do steps down; any other number rounds down to one of these |
| `fontHinting`, `fontGamma` | `"normal"`, `1.8` | Text rendering: `smooth`, `normal`, `monochrome` or `none`; gamma 1.0-3.0 |
| `animationTimerDelay` | `0.001` | Seconds between `requestAnimationFrame` ticks. Below the frame period (the default) rAF runs once per game frame, with the odd frame running it twice; Ultralight's own `1/60` ran it 40 times a second against a 60 Hz game. CSS animations and transitions step every frame either way |
| `cursorFile`, `cursorHeight` | `""`, `24` | The cursor is drawn in code (it glows over a clickable element and becomes an I-beam over text); `cursorFile` replaces it with your own image (relative to the runtime folder, or absolute, placed by `cursorHotspotX/Y`). `cursorHeight` is its height in pixels at 1080p (8-256), scaled with the resolution: 24 is 48 px at 4K |
| `cursorHotspotX`, `cursorHotspotY` | `0`, `0` | The pointer pixel of a `cursorFile` image, 0-1 across and down |
| `cursorForce`, `modCursors` | `false`, `true` | 0.31.0: mods may bring their own cursor. `cursorForce` `true` shows yours (your `cursorFile`, else the drawn cursor) everywhere, over every mod's cursor and over pages that hide the pointer. `modCursors` `false` ignores mods' cursor images and colours (0.31.1), but a page that draws its own pointer still hides yours. See "The cursor looks different over one mod, or disappears" |
| `loadStagger`, `loadBudgetMs` | `true`, `8` | 0.31.0: views not yet opened start loading their pages one per frame after a load, the next once the previous page is ready or failed (or 100 ms passed) and the last frame's page work took under `loadBudgetMs` (1-100), at most about a second per batch; a view being opened, or visible at creation, loads at once. `false` loads every page in the same frame, as before 0.31.0. See "Performance" |
| `stallWatchdog`, `stallThresholdMs` | `true`, `1500` | Log the present and main threads' stacks when no frame is presented for this long (250-60000 ms); the first time per session, every other thread's too |
| `vr` | see below | Skyrim VR only |

The `vr` block: `enabled` (`true`), `mirror` (`true`: keep drawing pages on the desktop mirror),
`panelFollow` (`false`: a panel stays where it opened; `true` glides it back when you look away,
tuned by `followAngleDeg` 45, `followMinDeg` 80 and `followDistM` 0.5), `panelDistanceM` (1.2),
`panelWidthM` (1.6), `panelHeightOffsetM` (-0.1), `panelWidth` / `panelHeight` (1600 / 900, the
page size of fullscreen views), `keyboard` (`true`: Magelight's own laser keyboard for text
fields), `runtimeKeyboard` (`false`), `beam` (`true`) and `beamAlpha` (0.55) for the laser,
`cursorScale` (0.012) and `cursorDot` (`true`) for its pointer, `suppressRuntimeLaser` (`true`:
hide OpenComposite's own menu laser over Magelight pages), `aimUseTip` (`true`) and
`aimPitchDeg` (-35) for the controller's aim.

## The UI stopped working partway through a session

`Magelight: SEH exception ... in frame work — overlay disabled, UI mode will drop` means something
crashed inside a frame, in Ultralight or in Magelight's own frame code. Magelight caught the crash so
the game keeps running, and turned its overlay off for the rest of the session: restart the game to
bring the UI back (loading a save does not). Post the whole log with the report. The
`Magelight VEH: exception ... (module <dll> +0x...)` line above it (with its `#NN` caller lines under
it) names the module and offset; a place that faulted earlier in the session is named by its first
line, and new places stop being logged after 64: `MgWCore.dll` is Ultralight's web engine (see the VEH section below). `MgWCore.dll +0xFB7F77` before 0.31.3
was a PC where Arial could not be loaded. Since 0.31.3 the `fonts:` lines near the top of the log
name the last-resort font the session uses and, when Arial could not be used, why.

## "Magelight VEH" and "Magelight stall" lines

`Magelight VEH: exception ...` records each serious exception raised on any thread of the
game, once per place it happens (up to 64 places a session), including ones another mod raises and
handles itself. The `Magelight VEH:   #01 <module>+0x...` lines under it are the calls that led
there, most recent first: they tell a fault Magelight caused from another mod's or the game's own
(a stack overflow gets the one line only, written a moment later by another thread when the
overflowed one has too little stack left to write it). `Magelight stall: ...`
records the stacks of the present and main threads when no frame was presented for longer than
`stallThresholdMs` (a long save or a hitch can do that). The first sample of a session also
records every other game thread (up to 64, labelled `other`), which names the thread a hang is
waiting on: post the whole block with a hang report. They are diagnostics written only to the log, and on their
own they do not mean Magelight crashed. Nothing is sent anywhere.

## A key typed into a page triggered another mod

On flat, while UI mode is on, Magelight mutes the engine's keyboard device: its DirectInput poll reads and discards the buffered keys instead of turning them into button events, so no keyboard button event exists anywhere in the engine — not for SKSE input sinks, not for mods that hook the input dispatcher (Immersive Equipment Displays' Backspace UI key was the field case), not for Papyrus `OnKeyDown` — and nothing replays into the game when the page closes. The page keeps typing through the window's own key messages, and so do Escape and Magelight's bound hotkeys. It also raises the engine's text-entry flag for the mods that check it. Mouse and gamepad are untouched. On VR the device is not muted (the page is typed from the engine's key events); Magelight takes each key out of the event chain before the input sinks registered after its own. A mod that reads the keyboard through the OS (`GetAsyncKeyState`) can still react; report those with the mod name.
