Scriptname Magelight Hidden
{Magelight UI - Papyrus tier. Every function is Global; the host DLL supplies them.
 A mod is a slug (modId). Views are integer ids (0 = none). See docs/PAPYRUS.md.

 Scripts act only on script-owned mods: a mod registered by a script, or declared
 by a manifest.json that no plugin (DLL) adopted, whose storage jar is its own (not
 "default", not a plugin's session). A slug or view a plugin owns is refused
 (false / 0 / nothing, one log line per function and target); FindView, IsVisible,
 IsUIModeActive, GetUIModeView, GetLastError, GetVersion* and IsReady work for any
 mod. Every script can drive every script-owned mod's views, so keep secrets out of
 page storage.

 Host events arrive as ModEvents (SKSE ModCallbackEvent), e.g.
   RegisterForModEvent("Magelight_ViewDomReady", "OnMlDomReady")
   Event OnMlDomReady(string eventName, string strArg, float numArg, Form sender)
 strArg = your modId, or modId|detail where the event carries text; numArg = view id.
 Registrations last for the current game session only: redo them on every load.
 Events: ViewDomReady, ViewLoadFailed, ViewReloaded, ViewDestroyed, UIModeEntered,
 UIModeExited, FocusDenied, DisplayResized, RenderDead, UIModeRefused.

 JS -> Papyrus: RegisterListener(view, "save") then in the page window.save("payload");
 arrives as ModEvent "Magelight_JS_save" (strArg = payload, numArg = view id).
 Papyrus -> JS: Call(view, "setState", json) invokes window.setState(json).}
